"""The cockpit's HTTP API: an app factory serving health, heartbeats, and Stats.

Three constraints, stated as contract:

* Every statistic leaves this API as a full ``Stat`` dict -- value plus n, n_clusters,
  both CI bounds, cost level, corpus id, facet (docs/plans/2026-07-05-desktop-ui-design.md,
  "The three mechanical rules", rule 1: the frontend has NO renderer for a bare float,
  so a number without provenance is unrepresentable).
* The connection label NEVER contains the URL, host, or credentials -- the Streamlit
  sidebar chip's guarantee (``dashboard/ui.py connection_label``), reimplemented here
  rather than imported because that module is slated for deletion with the dashboard.
* A dead database is a friendly answer, never a traceback: ``/api/health`` always
  answers 200 with ``connected: false`` plus a one-line summary; data endpoints answer
  503 with a JSON ``detail``. That covers MID-REQUEST failures too: a stale-schema
  local.db passes the SELECT-1 probe and then raises inside the endpoint, so an
  app-level ``SQLAlchemyError`` handler translates those to the same 503 posture.
  No stack trace and no URL in any response body.
